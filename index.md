## Lab Purpose and Components
Furthering familiarity with server-side javascript, in this lab, students were asked to use postman to learn about GET and POST routes with JSON.

## What I Learned
This lab really set the groundwork for project 4, and was a great, relatively approachable introduction to how the postman software can be used to help when creating servers.
